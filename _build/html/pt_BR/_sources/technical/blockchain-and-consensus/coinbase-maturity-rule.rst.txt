Coinbase Maturity Rule (aka Output Lock Heights)
================================================

Coinbase outputs (block rewards & fees) are “locked” and require 1,440
confirmations (i.e 24 hours worth of blocks added to the chain) before
they mature sufficiently to be spendable. This is to reduce the risk of
later txs being reversed if a chain reorganization occurs.

Bitcoin does something very similar, requiring 100 confirmations
(Bitcoin blocks are every 10 minutes, Grin blocks are every 60 seconds)
before mining rewards can be spent.

Grin enforces coinbase maturity in both the transaction pool and the
block validation pipeline. A transaction containing an input spending a
coinbase output cannot be added to the transaction pool until it has
sufficiently matured (based on current chain height and the height of
the block producing the coinbase output). Similarly a block is invalid
if it contains an input spending a coinbase output before it has
sufficiently matured, based on the height of the block containing the
input and the height of the block that originally produced the coinbase
output.

The maturity rule *only* applies to coinbase outputs, regular
transaction outputs have an effective lock height of zero.

An output consists of -

-  features (currently coinbase vs. non-coinbase)
-  commitment ``rG+vH``
-  rangeproof

To spend a regular transaction output two conditions must be met. We
need to show the output has not been previously spent and we need to
prove ownership of the output.

A Grin transaction consists of the following -

-  A set of inputs, each referencing a previous output being spent.
-  A set of new outputs that include -

   -  A value ``v`` and a blinding factor (private key) ``r`` multiplied
      on a curve and summed to be ``rG+vH``
   -  A range proof that shows that v is non-negative.

-  An explicit transaction fee in the clear.
-  A signature, computed by taking the excess blinding value (the sum of
   all outputs plus the fee, minus the inputs) and using it as the
   private key.

We can show the output is unspent by looking for the commitment in the
current Output set. The Output set is authoritative; if the output
exists in the Output set we know it has not yet been spent. If an output
does not exist in the Output set we know it has either never existed, or
that it previously existed and has been spent (we will not necessarily
know which).

To prove ownership we can verify the transaction signature. We can
*only* have signed the transaction if the transaction sums to zero *and*
we know both ``v`` and ``r``.

Knowing ``v`` and ``r`` we can uniquely identify the output (via its
commitment) *and* we can prove ownership of the output by validating the
signature on the original coinbase transaction.

Grin does not permit duplicate commitments to exist in the Output set at
the same time. But once an output is spent it is removed from the Output
set and a duplicate commitment can be added back into the Output set.
This is not necessarily recommended but Grin must handle this situation
in a way that does not break consensus across the network.

Several things complicate this situation -

1. It is possible for two blocks to have identical rewards, particularly
   for the case of empty blocks, but also possible for non-empty blocks
   with transaction fees.
2. It is possible for a non-coinbase output to have the same value as a
   coinbase output.
3. It is possible (but not recommended) for a miner to reuse private
   keys.

Grin does not allow duplicate commitments to exist in the Output set
simultaneously. But the Output set is specific to the state of a
particular chain fork. It *is* possible for duplicate *identical*
commitments to exist simultaneously on different concurrent forks. And
these duplicate commitments may have different “lock heights” at which
they mature and become spendable on the different forks.

-  Output O1 from block B1 spendable at height h1 (on fork f1)
-  Output O1’ from block B2 spendable at height h2 (on fork f2)

The complication here is that input I1 will spend either O1 or O1’
depending on which fork the block containing I1 exists on. And crucially
I1 may be valid at a particular block height on one fork but not the
other.

Said another way - a commitment may refer to multiple outputs, all of
which may have different lock heights. And we *must* ensure we correctly
identify which output is actually being spent and that the coinbase
maturity rules are correctly enforced based on the current chain state.

A coinbase output, locked with the coinbase maturity rule at a specific
lock height, *cannot* be uniquely identified, and *cannot* be safely
spent by their commitment alone. To spend a coinbase output we need to
know one additional piece of information -

-  The block the coinbase output originated from

Given this, we can verify the height of the block and derive the “lock
height” of the output (+ 1,000 blocks).
