<div class="section" id="general-introduction">
<h2>General introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#general-introduction" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h2>
<p>In cryptography a <em>Commitment</em> (or <em>commitment scheme</em>) refers to a
concept which can be imagined like a box with a lock. You can put
something into the box (for example a piece of a paper with a secret
number written on it), lock it and give it to another person (or the
public).</p>
<p>The other person doesn’t know yet what’s the secret number in the box,
but if you decide to publish your secret number later in time and want
to prove that this really is the secret which you came up with in the
first place (and not a different one) you can prove this simply by
giving the key of the box to the other person.</p>
<p>They can unlock the box, compare the secret within the box with the
secret you just published and can be sure that you didn’t change your
secret since you locked it. You “<strong>committed</strong>” to the secret number
beforehand, meaning you cannot change it between the time of commitment
and the time of revealing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="hash-commitment">
<h3>Hash Commitment<a class="headerlink" href="#hash-commitment" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h3>
<p>A simple commitment scheme can be realized with a cryptographic hash
function. For example: Alice and Bob want to play <em>“Guess my number”</em>
and Alice comes up with with her really secret number <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">29</span></code> which Bob
has to guess in the game, then before the game starts, Alice calculates:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">hash</span><span class="p">(</span> <span class="mi">29</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">r</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>and publishes the result to Bob. The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> is a randomly chosen
<em>Blinding Factor</em> which is needed because otherwise Bob could just try
hashing all the possible numbers for the game and compare the hashes.</p>
<p>When the game is finished, Alice simply needs to publish her secret
number <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">29</span></code> and the blinding factor <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> and Bob can calculate the
hash himself and easily verify that Alice did not change the secret
number during the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pedersen-commitment">
<h3>Pedersen Commitment<a class="headerlink" href="#pedersen-commitment" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h3>
<p>Other, more advanced commitment schemes can have additional properties.
For example Mimblewimble and Confidential Transactions (CT) make heavy
use of <a class="reference external" href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/3-540-46766-1_9.pdf">Pedersen
Commitments</a>,
which are <em>homomorphic</em> commitments. Homomorphic in this context means
that (speaking in the “box” metaphor from above) you can take two of
these locked boxes (<em>box1</em> and <em>box2</em>) and somehow “<em>add</em>” them
together, so that you get a single box as result (which still is
locked), and if you open this single box later (like in the examples
before) the secret it contains, is the sum of the secrets from <em>box1</em>
and <em>box2</em>.</p>
<p>While this “box” metaphor no longer seems to be reasonable in the
real-world this is perfectly possible using the properties of operations
on elliptic curves.</p>
<p>Look into <a class="reference external" href="../introduction-to-mimblewimble.md">Introduction to
Mimblewimble</a> for further details
on Pedersen Commitments and how they are used in Grin.</p>

<div class="section" id="properties-of-commitment-schemes">
<h2>Properties of commitment schemes:<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-of-commitment-schemes" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h2>
<p>In general for any commitment scheme we can identify two important
properties which can be weaker or stronger, depending on the type of
commitment scheme:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>Hidingness (or Confidentiality):</strong> How good is the commitment
scheme protecting the secret commitment. Or speaking in terms of our
example from above: what would an attacker need to open the box (and
learn the secret number) without having the key to unlock it?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bindingness:</strong> Is it possible at all (or how hard would it be) for
an attacker to somehow find a different secret, which would produce
the same commitment, so that the attacker could later open the
commitment to a different secret, thus breaking the <em>binding</em> of the
commitment.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="security-of-these-properties">
<h3>Security of these properties:<a class="headerlink" href="#security-of-these-properties" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h3>
<p>For these two properties different security levels can be identified.</p>
<p>The two most important combinations of these are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><strong>perfectly binding</strong> and <strong>computationally hiding</strong> commitment
schemes and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>computationally binding</strong> and <strong>perfectly hiding</strong> commitment
schemes</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“<em>Computationally</em>” binding or hiding means that the property
(bindingness/hidingness) is secured by the fact that the underlying
mathematical problem is too hard to be solved with existing computing
power in reasonable time (i.e. not breakable today as computational
resources are bound in the real world).</p>
<p>“<em>Perfectly</em>” binding or hiding means that even with infinite computing
power it would be impossible to break the property
(bindingness/hidingness).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="mutual-exclusivity">
<h3>Mutual exclusivity:<a class="headerlink" href="#mutual-exclusivity" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is important to realize that it’s <strong>impossible</strong> that any commitment
scheme can be <em>perfectly binding</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>perfectly hiding</em> at the same
time. This can be easily shown with a thought experiment: Imagine an
attacker having infinite computing power, he could simply generate a
commitment for all possible values (and blinding factors) until finding
a pair that outputs the same commitment. If we further assume the
commitment scheme is <em>perfectly binding</em> (meaning there cannot be two
different values leading to the same commitment) this uniquely would
identify the value within the commitment, thus breaking the hidingness.</p>
<p>The same is true the other way around. If a commitment scheme is
<em>perfectly hiding</em> there must exist several input values resulting in
the same commitment (otherwise an attacker with infinite computing power
could just try all possible values as described above). This concludes
that the commitment scheme cannot be <em>perfectly binding</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="always-a-compromise">
<h4>Always a compromise<a class="headerlink" href="#always-a-compromise" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h4>
<p>The key take-away point is this: it’s <strong>always a compromise</strong>, you can
never have both properties (<em>hidingness</em> and <em>bindingness</em>) with
<em>perfect</em> security. If one is <em>perfectly</em> secure then the other can be
at most <em>computationally</em> secure (and the other way around).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="considerations-for-cryptocurrencies">
<h3>Considerations for cryptocurrencies<a class="headerlink" href="#considerations-for-cryptocurrencies" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h3>
<p>Which roles do these properties play in the design of cryptocurrencies?</p>
<p><strong>Hidingness</strong>: In privacy oriented cryptocurrencies like Grin,
commitment schemes are used to secure the contents of transactions. The
sender commits to an amount of coins he sends, but for the general
public the concrete amount should remain private (protected by the
<em>hidingness</em> property of the commitment scheme).</p>
<p><strong>Bindingness</strong>: At the same time no transaction creator should ever be
able to change his commitment to a different transaction amount later in
time. If this would be possible, an attacker could spend more coins than
previously committed to in an UTXO (unspent transaction output) and
therefore inflate coins out of thin air. Even worse, as the amounts are
hidden, this could go undetected.</p>
<p>So there is a valid interest in having both of these properties always
secured and never be violated.</p>
<p>Even with the intent being that both of these properties will hold for
the lifetime of a cryptocurrency, still a choice has to be made about
which commitment scheme to use.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-hard-choice">
<h4>A hard choice?<a class="headerlink" href="#a-hard-choice" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h4>
<p>Which one of these two properties needs to be <em>perfectly</em> safe and for
which one it would be sufficient to be <em>computationally</em> safe? Or in
other words: in case of a disaster, if the commitment scheme
unexpectedly gets broken, which one of the two properties should be
valued higher? Economical soundness (no hidden inflation possible) or
ensured privacy (privacy will be preserved)?</p>
<p>This seems like a hard to choice to make.</p>
<p>If we look closer into this we realize that the commitment scheme only
needs to be <em>perfectly</em> binding at the point in time when the scheme
actually gets broken. Until then it will be safe even if it’s only
<em>computationally</em> binding.</p>
<p>At the same time a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency needs to ensure the
<em>hidingness</em> property <strong>forever</strong>. Unlike the <em>binding</em> property, which
only is important at the time when a transaction is created and will not
affect past transactions, the <em>hidingness</em> property must be ensured at
all times. Otherwise, in the unfortunate case should the commitment
scheme be broken, an attacker could go back in the chain and unblind
past transactions, thus break the privacy property retroactively.</p>

<div class="section" id="properties-of-pedersen-commitments">
<h2>Properties of Pedersen Commitments<a class="headerlink" href="#properties-of-pedersen-commitments" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h2>
<p>Pedersen Commitments are <strong>computationally binding</strong> and <strong>perfectly
hiding</strong> as for a given commitment to the value <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v</span></code>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v*H</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">r*G</span></code>
there may exist a pair of different values <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r1</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v1</span></code> such that
the sum will be the same. Even if you have infinite computing power and
could try all possible values, you would not be able to tell which one
is the original one (thus <em>perfectly hiding</em>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="introducing-switch-commitments">
<h2>Introducing Switch Commitments<a class="headerlink" href="#introducing-switch-commitments" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h2>
<p>So what can be done if the bindingness of the Pedersen Commitment
unexpectedly gets broken?</p>
<p>In general a cryptocurrency confronted with a broken commitment scheme
could choose to change the scheme in use, but the problem with this
approach would be that it requires to create new transaction outputs
using the new scheme to make funds secure again. This would require
every coin holder to move his coins into new transaction outputs. If
coins are not moved into new outputs, they will not profit from the
security of the new commitment scheme. Also, this has to happen
<strong>before</strong> the scheme gets actually broken in the wild, otherwise the
existing UTXOs no longer can be assumed to contain correct values.</p>
<p>In this situation <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/237.pdf">Switch
Commitments</a> offer a neat
solution. These type of commitments allow changing the properties of the
commitments just by changing the revealing / validating procedure
without changing the way commitments are created. (You “<em>switch</em>” to a
new validation scheme which is backwards compatible with commitments
created long before the actual “<em>switch</em>”).</p>
<div class="section" id="how-does-this-work-in-detail">
<h3>How does this work in detail<a class="headerlink" href="#how-does-this-work-in-detail" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h3>
<p>First let’s introduce a new commitment scheme: The <strong>ElGamal
commitment</strong> scheme is a commitment scheme similiar to Pedersen
Commitments and it’s <em>perfectly binding</em> (but only <em>computationally
hiding</em> as we can never have both). It looks very similar to a Pedersen
Commitment, with the addition of a new element, calculated by
multiplying the blinding factor <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> with another generator point
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">J</span></code>:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">H</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">G</span> <span class="p">,</span>  <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">J</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>So if we store the additional field <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r*J</span></code> and ignore it for now, we
can treat it like Pedersen Commitments, until we decide to also validate
the full ElGamal commitment at some time in future. This is exactly what
was implemented in an <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/blob/5a47a1710112153fb38e4406251c9874c366f1c0/core/src/core/transaction.rs#L812">earlier version of
Grin</a>,
before mainnet was launched. In detail: the hashed value of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r*J</span></code>
(<em>switch_commit_hash</em>) was added to the transaction output, but this
came with the burden of increasing the size of each output by 32 bytes.</p>
<p>Fortunately, later on the Mimblewimble mailinglist Tim Ruffing came up
with a really <a class="reference external" href="https://lists.launchpad.net/mimblewimble/msg00479.html">beautiful
idea</a>
(initially suggested by Pieter Wuille), which offers the same advantages
but doesn’t need this extra storage of an additional element per
transaction output:</p>
<p>The idea is the following:</p>
<p>A normal Pedersen commitment looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">H</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">G</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v</span></code> is value of the input/output, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> is a truly random blinding
factor, and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">H</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">G</span></code> are two generator points on the elliptic
curve).</p>
<p>If we adapt this by having <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> not being random itself, but using
another random number <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r'</span></code> and create the Pedersen Commitment:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">H</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">r</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">G</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>such that:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">r</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="sa">r</span><span class="s1">&#39; + hash( v*H + r&#39;</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="n">G</span>  <span class="p">,</span>  <span class="sa">r</span><span class="s1">&#39;*J )</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>(using the additional third generation point <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">J</span></code> on the curve) then
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> still is perfectly valid as a blinding factor, as it’s still
randomly distributed, but now we see that the part within the brackets
of the hash function (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">v*H</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">r'*G</span>&#160; <span class="pre">,</span>&#160; <span class="pre">r'*J</span></code>) is an <strong>ElGamal
commitment</strong>.</p>
<p>This neat idea lead to the removal of the switch commitment hash from
the outputs in this (and following) <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin/issues/998">pull
requests</a> as now it
could be easily included into the Pedersen Commitments.</p>
<p>This is how it is currently implemented in Grin. Pedersen commitments
are used for the Confidential Transaction but instead of choosing the
blinding factor <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code> only by random, it is calculated by adding the
hash of an ElGamal commitment to a random <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r'</span></code> (see here in
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/mimblewimble/secp256k1-zkp/blob/73617d0fcc4f51896cce4f9a1a6977a6958297f8/src/modules/commitment/main_impl.h#L267">main_impl.h#L267</a>).</p>
<p>In general switch commitments were first described in the paper <a class="reference external" href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/237.pdf">“Switch
Commitments: A Safety Switch for Confidential
Transactions”</a>). The
<strong>“switch”</strong> in the name comes from the fact that you can virtually flip
a “switch” in the future and simply by changing the validation procedure
you can change the strength of the bindingness and hidingness property
of your commitments and this even works in a backwards compatible way
with commitments created today.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusion">
<h2>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h2>
<p>Grin uses Pedersen Commitments - like other privacy cryptocurrencies do
as well - with the only difference that the random blinding factor <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">r</span></code>
is created using the ElGamal commitment scheme.</p>
<p>This might not seem like a big change on a first look, but it provides
an important safety measure:</p>
<p>Pedersen Commitments are already <em>perfectly hiding</em> so whatever happens,
privacy will never be at risk without requiring any action from users.
But in case of a disaster if the bindingness of the commitment scheme
gets broken, then switch commitments can be enabled (via a soft fork)
requiring that all new transactions prove that their commitment is not
breaking the bindingness by validating the full ElGamal commitment.</p>
<p>But in this case users would still have a choice:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>they can decide to continue to create new transactions, even if this
might compromise their privacy (only on their <strong>last</strong> UTXOs) as the
ElGamal commitment scheme is only computationally hiding, but at
least they would still have access to their coins</p></li>
<li><p>or users can decide to just leave the money alone, walk away and make
no more transactions (but preserve their privacy, as their old
transactions only validated the Pedersen commitment which is
perfectly hiding)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many cases where a privacy leak is much more dangerous to
one’s life than some cryptocurrency might be worth. But this is a
decision that should be left up to the individual user and switch
commitments enable this type of choice.</p>
<p>It should be made clear that this is a safety measure meant to be
enabled in case of a disaster. If advances in computing would put the
hardness of the discrete log problem in question, a lot of other
cryptographic systems, including other cryptocurrencies, will be in
urgent need of updating their primitives to a future-proof system. The
switch commitments just provide an additional layer of security if the
bindingness of Pedersen commitments ever breaks unexpectedly.</p>
