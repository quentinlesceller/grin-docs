<p>This document is meant to outline, at a level suitable for someone
without prior knowledge, the algorithms and processes currently involved
in Grin’s Proof-of-Work system. We’ll start with a general overview of
cycles in a graph and the Cuckoo Cycle algorithm which forms the basis
of Grin’s proof-of-work. We’ll then move on to Grin-specific details,
which will outline the other systems that combine with Cuckoo Cycle to
form the entirety of mining in Grin.</p>
<p>Please note that Grin is currently under active development, and any and
all of this is subject to (and will) change before a general release.</p>
<div class="section" id="graphs-and-cuckoo-cycle">
<h2>Graphs and Cuckoo Cycle<a class="headerlink" href="#graphs-and-cuckoo-cycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Grin’s basic Proof-of-Work algorithm is called Cuckoo Cycle, which is
specifically designed to be resistant to Bitcoin style hardware
arms-races. It is primarily a memory bound algorithm, which, (at least
in theory,) means that solution time is bound by memory bandwidth rather
than raw processor or GPU speed. As such, mining Cuckoo Cycle solutions
should be viable on most commodity hardware, and require far less energy
than most other GPU, CPU or ASIC-bound proof of work algorithms.</p>
<p>The Cuckoo Cycle POW is the work of John Tromp, and the most up-to-date
documentation and implementations can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo">his github
repository</a>. The <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo/blob/master/doc/cuckoo.pdf">white
paper</a> is
the best source of further technical details.</p>
<p>There is also a <a class="reference external" href="https://moneromonitor.libsyn.com/e14-john-tromp-on-cuckoo-cycle-pow-john-mcafee-on-monero">podcast with Mike from Monero
Monitor</a>
in which John Tromp talks at length about Cuckoo Cycle; recommended
listening for anyone wanting more background on Cuckoo Cycle, including
more technical detail, the history of the algorithm’s development and
some of the motivations behind it.</p>
<div class="section" id="cycles-in-a-graph">
<h3>Cycles in a Graph<a class="headerlink" href="#cycles-in-a-graph" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Cuckoo Cycle is an algorithm meant to detect cycles in a bipartite graph
of N nodes and M edges. In plain terms, a bipartite graph is one in
which edges (i.e. lines connecting nodes) travel only between 2 separate
groups of nodes. In the case of the Cuckoo hashtable in Cuckoo Cycle,
one side of the graph is an array numbered with odd indices (up to the
size of the graph), and the other is numbered with even indices. A node
is simply a numbered ‘space’ on either side of the Cuckoo Table, and an
Edge is a line connecting two nodes on opposite sides. The simple graph
below denotes just such a graph, with 4 nodes on the ‘even’ side (top),
4 nodes on the odd side (bottom) and zero Edges (i.e. no lines
connecting any nodes.)</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id1">

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">alt text</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p><em>A graph of 8 Nodes with Zero Edges</em></p>
<p>Let’s throw a few Edges into the graph now, randomly:</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id2">
<img alt="alt text" src="../../_images/cuckoo_base_numbered_few_edges.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">alt text</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p><em>8 Nodes with 4 Edges, no solution</em></p>
<p>We now have a randomly-generated graph with 8 nodes (N) and 4 edges (M),
or an NxM graph where N=8 and M=4. Our basic Proof-of-Work is now
concerned with finding ‘cycles’ of a certain length within this random
graph, or, put simply, a series of connected nodes starting and ending
on the same node. So, if we were looking for a cycle of length 4 (a path
connecting 4 nodes, starting and ending on the same node), one cannot be
detected in this graph.</p>
<p>Adjusting the number of Edges M relative to the number of Nodes N
changes the difficulty of the cycle-finding problem, and the probability
that a cycle exists in the current graph. For instance, if our POW
problem were concerned with finding a cycle of length 4 in the graph,
the current difficulty of 4/8 (M/N) would mean that all 4 edges would
need to be randomly generated in a perfect cycle (from 0-5-4-1-0) in
order for there to be a solution.</p>
<p>Let’s add a few more edges, again at random:</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id3">
<img alt="alt text" src="../../_images/cuckoo_base_numbered_more_edges.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">alt text</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id3" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p><em>8 Nodes with 7 Edges</em></p>
<p>Where we can find a cycle:</p>
<div class="figure align-default" id="id4">
<img alt="alt text" src="../../_images/cuckoo_base_numbered_more_edges_cycle.png" />
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">alt text</span><a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Permalink to this image">¶</a></p>
</div>
<p><em>Cycle Found from 0-5-4-1-0</em></p>
<p>If you increase the number of edges relative to the number of nodes, you
increase the probability that a solution exists. With a few more edges
added to the graph above, a cycle of length 4 has appeared from
0-5-4-1-0, and the graph has a solution.</p>
<p>Thus, modifying the ratio M/N changes the number of expected occurrences
of a cycle for a graph with randomly generated edges.</p>
<p>For a small graph such as the one above, determining whether a cycle of
a certain length exists is trivial. But as the graphs get larger,
detecting such cycles becomes more difficult. For instance, does this
graph have a cycle of length 8, i.e. 8 connected nodes starting and
ending on the same node?</p>

</div>
<p><em>Meat-space Cycle Detection exercise</em></p>
<p>The answer is left as an exercise to the reader, but the overall
takeaways are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Detecting cycles in a graph becomes more difficult exercise as the
size of a graph grows.</p></li>
<li><p>The probability of a cycle of a given length in a graph increases as
M/N becomes larger, i.e. you add more edges relative to the number of
nodes in a graph.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="cuckoo-cycle">
<h3>Cuckoo Cycle<a class="headerlink" href="#cuckoo-cycle" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Cuckoo Cycle algorithm is a specialized algorithm designed to solve
exactly this problem, and it does so by inserting values into a
structure called a ‘Cuckoo Hashtable’ according to a hash which maps
nodes into possible locations in two separate arrays. This document
won’t go into detail on the base algorithm, as it’s outlined plainly
enough in section 5 of the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/tromp/cuckoo/blob/master/doc/cuckoo.pdf">white
paper</a>.
There are also several variants on the algorithm that make various
speed/memory tradeoffs, again beyond the scope of this document.
However, there are a few details following from the above that we need
to keep in mind before going on to more technical aspects of Grin’s
proof-of-work.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The ‘random’ edges in the graph demonstrated above are not actually
random but are generated by putting edge indices (0..N) through a
seeded hash function, SIPHASH. Each edge index is put through the
SIPHASH function twice to create two edge endpoints, with the first
input value being 2 * edge_index, and the second 2 * edge_index+1.
The seed for this function is based on a hash of a block header,
outlined further below.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘Proof’ created by this algorithm is a set of nonces that
generate a cycle of length 42, which can be trivially validated by
other peers.</p></li>
<li><p>Two main parameters, as explained above, are passed into the Cuckoo
Cycle algorithm that affect the probability of a solution, and the
time it takes to search the graph for a solution:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The M/N ratio outlined above, which controls the number of edges
relative to the size of the graph. Cuckoo Cycle fixes M at N/2,
which limits the number of cycles to a few at most.</p></li>
<li><p>The size of the graph itself</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How these parameters interact in practice is looked at in more <a class="reference external" href="#mining-loop-difficulty-control-and-timing">detail
below</a>.</p>
<p>Now, (hopefully) armed with a basic understanding of what the Cuckoo
Cycle algorithm is intended to do, as well as the parameters that affect
how difficult it is to find a solution, we move on to the other portions
of Grin’s POW system.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="mining-in-grin">
<h2>Mining in Grin<a class="headerlink" href="#mining-in-grin" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Cuckoo Cycle outlined above forms the basis of Grin’s mining
process, however Grin uses Cuckoo Cycle in tandem with several other
systems to create a Proof-of-Work.</p>
<div class="section" id="additional-difficulty-control">
<h3>Additional Difficulty Control<a class="headerlink" href="#additional-difficulty-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In order to provide additional difficulty control in a manner that meets
the needs of a network with constantly evolving hashpower availability,
a further Hashcash-based difficulty check is applied to potential
solution sets as follows:</p>
<p>If the Blake2b hash of a potential set of solution nonces (currently an
array of 42 u32s representing the cycle nonces,) is less than an
evolving difficulty target T, then the solution is considered valid.
More precisely, the proof difficulty is calculated as the maximum target
hash (2^256) divided by the current hash, rounded to give an integer. If
this integer is larger than the evolving network difficulty, the POW is
considered valid and the block is submit to the chain for validation.</p>
<p>In other words, a potential proof, as well as containing a valid Cuckoo
Cycle, also needs to hash to a value higher than the target difficulty.
This difficulty is derived from:</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evolving-network-difficulty">
<h3>Evolving Network Difficulty<a class="headerlink" href="#evolving-network-difficulty" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The difficulty target is intended to evolve according to the available
network hashpower, with the goal of keeping the average block solution
time within range of a target (currently 60 seconds, though this is
subject to change).</p>
<p>The difficulty calculation is based on both Digishield and GravityWave
family of difficulty computation, coming to something very close to
ZCash. The reference difficulty is an average of the difficulty over a
window of 23 blocks (the current consensus value). The corresponding
timespan is calculated by using the difference between the median
timestamps at the beginning and the end of the window. If the timespan
is higher or lower than a certain range, (adjusted with a dampening
factor to allow for normal variation,) then the difficulty is raised or
lowered to a value aiming for the target block solve time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-mining-loop">
<h3>The Mining Loop<a class="headerlink" href="#the-mining-loop" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All of these systems are put together in the mining loop, which attempts
to create valid Proofs-of-Work to create the latest block in the chain.
The following is an outline of what the main mining loop does during a
single iteration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Get the latest chain state and build a block on top of it, which
includes</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A Block Header with new values particular to this mining attempt,
which are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The latest target difficulty as selected by the <a class="reference external" href="#evolving-network-difficulty">evolving
network difficulty</a> algorithm</p></li>
<li><p>A set of transactions available for validation selected from
the transaction pool</p></li>
<li><p>A coinbase transaction (which we’re hoping to give to
ourselves)</p></li>
<li><p>The current timestamp</p></li>
<li><p>A randomly generated nonce to add further randomness to the
header’s hash</p></li>
<li><p>The merkle root of the UTXO set and fees (not yet implemented)</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Then, a sub-loop runs for a set amount of time, currently
configured at 2 seconds, where the following happens:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The new block header is hashed to create a hash value</p></li>
<li><p>The cuckoo graph generator is initialized, which accepts
as parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The hash of the potential block header, which is to be
used as the key to a SIPHASH function that will
generate pairs of locations for each element in a set
of nonces 0..N in the graph.</p></li>
<li><p>The size of the graph (a consensus value).</p></li>
<li><p>An easiness value, (a consensus value) representing
the M/N ratio described above denoting the probability
of a solution appearing in the graph</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The Cuckoo Cycle detection algorithm tries to find a
solution (i.e. a cycle of length 42) within the generated
graph.</p></li>
<li><p>If a cycle is found, a Blake2b hash of the proof is
created and is compared to the current target difficulty,
as outlined in <a class="reference external" href="#additional-difficulty-control">Additional Difficulty
Control</a> above.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Blake2b Hash difficulty is greater than or equal
to the target difficulty, the block is sent to the
transaction pool, propagated amongst peers for
validation, and work begins on the next block.</p></li>
<li><p>If the Blake2b Hash difficulty is less than the target
difficulty, the proof is thrown out and the timed loop
continues.</p></li>
<li><p>If no solution is found, increment the nonce in the
header by 1, and update the header’s timestamp so the
next iteration hashes a different value for seeding the
next loop’s graph generation step.</p></li>
<li><p>If the loop times out with no solution found, start over
again from the top, collecting new transactions and
creating a new block altogether.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="mining-loop-difficulty-control-and-timing">
<h3>Mining Loop Difficulty Control and Timing<a class="headerlink" href="#mining-loop-difficulty-control-and-timing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Controlling the overall difficulty of the mining loop requires finding a
balance between the three values outlined above:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Graph size (currently represented as a bit-shift value n representing
a size of 2^n nodes, consensus value DEFAULT_SIZESHIFT). Smaller
graphs can be exhaustively searched more quickly, but will also have
fewer solutions for a given easiness value. A very small graph needs
a higher easiness value to have the same chance to have a solution as
a larger graph with a lower easiness value.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘Easiness’ consensus value, or the M/N ratio of the graph
expressed as a percentage. The higher this value, the more likely it
is a generated graph will contain a solution. In tandem with the
above, the larger the graph, the more solutions it will contain for a
given easiness value. The Cuckoo Cycle implementations fix this M to
N/2, giving a ratio of 50%</p></li>
<li><p>The evolving network difficulty hash.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These values need to be carefully tweaked in order for the mining
algorithm to find the right balance between the cuckoo graph size and
the evolving difficulty. The POW needs to remain mostly Cuckoo Cycle
based, but still allow for reasonably short block times that allow new
transactions to be quickly processed.</p>
<p>If the graph size is too low and the easiness too high, for instance,
then many cuckoo cycle solutions can easily be found for a given block,
and the POW will start to favour those who can hash faster, precisely
what Cuckoo Cycle is trying to avoid. If the graph is too large and
easiness too low, however, then it can potentially take any solver a
long time to find a solution in a single graph, well outside a window in
which you’d like to stop to collect new transactions.</p>
<p>These values are currently set to 2^12 for the graph size and 50% (as
fixed by Cuckoo Cycle) for the easiness value, however the size is only
a temporary values for testing. The current miner implementation is very
unoptimized, and the graph size will need to be changed as faster and
more optimized Cuckoo Cycle algorithms are put in place.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pooling-capability">
<h3>Pooling Capability<a class="headerlink" href="#pooling-capability" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Contrary to some existing concerns about Cuckoo Cycle’s poolability, the
POW implementation in Grin as described above is perfectly suited to a
mining pool. While it may be difficult to prove efforts to solve a
single graph in isolation, the combination of factors within Grin’s
proof-of-work combine to enforce a notion called ‘progress-freeness’,
which enables ‘poolability’ as well as a level of fairness among all
miners.</p>
<div class="section" id="progress-freeness">
<h4>Progress Freeness<a class="headerlink" href="#progress-freeness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Progress-freeness is central to the ‘poolability’ of a proof-of-work,
and is simply based on the idea that a solution to a POW problem can be
found within a reasonable amount of time. For instance, if a blockchain
has a one minute POW time and miners have to spend one minute on average
to find a solution, this still satisfies the POW requirement but gives a
strong advantage to big miners. In such a setup, small miners will
generally lose at least one minute every time while larger miners can
move on as soon as they find a solution. So in order to keep mining
relatively progress-free, a POW that requires multiple solution attempts
with each attempt taking a relatively small amount of time is desirable.</p>
<p>Following from this, Grin’s progress-freeness is due to the fact that a
solution to a Cuckoo with Grin’s default parameters can typically be
found in under a second on most GPUs, and there is the additional
requirement of the Blake2b difficulty check on top of that. Members of a
pool are thus able to prove they’re working on a solution to a block by
submitting valid Cuckoo solutions (or a small bundle of them) that
simply fall under the current network target difficulty.</p>
