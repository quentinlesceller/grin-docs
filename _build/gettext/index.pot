msgid "Privacy by Default"
msgstr ""

#: ../../index.rst:43
msgid "This enables complete fungibility without precluding the ability to selectively disclose information as needed. Scales mostly with the number of users and minimally with the number of transactions (<100 byte kernel), resulting in a large space saving compared to other blockchains."
